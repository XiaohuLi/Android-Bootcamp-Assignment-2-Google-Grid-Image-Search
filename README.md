Please review my assignment 2.

Here is what I accomplished:

* User can enter a search query that will display a grid of image results from the Google Image API.
* User can click on "settings" which allows selection of advanced search options to filter results
* User can configure advanced search filters such as:
    Size (small, medium, large, extra-large)
    Color filter (black, blue, brown, gray, green, etc...)
    Type (faces, photo, clip art, line art)
    Site (espn.com)
* Subsequent searches will have any filters applied to the search results
* User can tap on any image in results to see the image full-screen
* User can scroll down “infinitely” to continue loading more image results (up to 8 pages)
* Robust error handling, check if internet is available, handle error cases, network failures
